    "## Question 1: Snakes and Ladders (Led by Rany)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classic childhood game of Snakes and Ladders, all players start to the left of square 1 (call this position 0) and roll a 6-sided die to represent the number of squares they can move forward. The goal is to reach square 100 as quickly as possible. Landing on the bottom rung of a ladder allows for an automatic free-pass to climb, e.g. square 4 sends you directly to 14; whereas landing on a snake's head forces one to slide all the way to the tail, e.g. square 34 sends you to 6. Note, this game can be viewed as a Markov Process, where the outcome is only depedent on the current state and not the prior trajectory. In this question, we will ask you to both formally describe the Markov Process that describes this game, followed by coding up a version of the game to get familiar with the RL-book libraries.\n",

    "<span style=\"color:red\">\n",
    "The transition probabilities for each square can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For squares without snakes or ladders, the transition probability is uniformly distributed over the next 6 squares (or fewer if near the end of the board).\n",
    "- For squares with ladders, the transition probability is 1 for the square at the top of the ladder.\n",
    "- For squares with snakes, the transition probability is 1 for the square at the tail of the snake.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a player is on square 1, the transition probabilities are:\n",
    "- P(2|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(3|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(4|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(5|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(6|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(7|1) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also write it as this. If a player is on square k, the transition probabilities are:\n",
    "- P(k+1|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+2|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+3|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+4|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+5|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+6|k) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player is on square 4 (bottom of a ladder to 14), the transition probability is:\n",
    "- P(14|4) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player is on square 34 (head of a snake to 6), the transition probability is:\n",
    "- P(6|34) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can therefore have $P(s'|s) = \\frac{1}{6}$ if $s' = s+r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if $s\\geq 94$, we have to ensure that players to not exceed position 100. For example, $T(97, 100) = \\frac{2}{6}$ because rolling 3 or more lands the player at 100. \n",

However, the remaining term, which involves the weighted sum of the values $v_{k-1}(s')$, depends on the transition probabilities and favors $a_1$. Specifically, for the non-zero value states $s_1$ and $s_2$, the probabilities $P(s_1, a_1, s')$ are larger than $P(s_1, a_2, s')$. For $s_3$, the probabilities are reversed, but since $v_{k-1}(s_3) = 0$, this term does not contribute to the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "At iteration 2, we observe that the weighted sum term exceeds the initial reward advantage of 2 for $a_2$, as shown by the calculations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "q_2(s_1, a_1) = 13.55, \\quad q_2(s_1, a_2) = 12.8,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $q_2(s_1, a_1) > q_2(s_1, a_2)$. This establishes that action $a_1$ becomes preferred by iteration 2. Moreover, since the value function $v_k(s)$ is non-decreasing with each iteration, the weighted sum term will either stay the same or increase, further reinforcing the dominance of $a_1$ over $a_2$ for $k > 2$. Once $q_k(s_1, a_1)$ surpasses $q_k(s_1, a_2)$ by more than 2, the inequality holds for all subsequent iterations because the probabilities associated with $a_1$ remain larger for the non-zero value states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we conclude that for $k > 2$, action $a_1$ will always be chosen for $s_1$, and the policy $\\pi_k(s_1) = a_1$ remains optimal. This argument shows that $\\pi_2(s_1) = a_1$ is the optimal deterministic policy for $s_1$, and this choice will not change in future iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the state **$\\mathbf{s_2}$** the answer is more straightforward. We observe that the policy $\\pi_k(s_2)$ has remained the same for two consecutive iterations ($\\pi_2(s_2) = \\pi_3(s_2) = \\pi_4(s_2) = a_1$). This indicates that the greedy policy has stabilized, meaning that action $a_1$ consistently provides the highest $q_k(s_2, a)$ value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the computed $q_k(s_2, a_1)$ and $q_k(s_2, a_2)$ values are becoming closer with each iteration. This decreasing difference between $q_k(s_2, a_1)$ and $q_k(s_2, a_2)$ reflects the fact that the value function $v_k(s_2)$ is converging, and the influence of future updates on the policy decision is diminishing. Since the greedy policy $\\pi_k(s_2)$ selects the action that maximizes $q_k(s_2, a)$, and this choice has stabilized across iterations, we can conclude that the policy $\\pi_k(s_2) = a_1$ is fixed for all $k > 2$.
