    "## Question 1: Snakes and Ladders (Led by ______)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classic childhood game of Snakes and Ladders, all players start to the left of square 1 (call this position 0) and roll a 6-sided die to represent the number of squares they can move forward. The goal is to reach square 100 as quickly as possible. Landing on the bottom rung of a ladder allows for an automatic free-pass to climb, e.g. square 4 sends you directly to 14; whereas landing on a snake's head forces one to slide all the way to the tail, e.g. square 34 sends you to 6. Note, this game can be viewed as a Markov Process, where the outcome is only depedent on the current state and not the prior trajectory. In this question, we will ask you to both formally describe the Markov Process that describes this game, followed by coding up a version of the game to get familiar with the RL-book libraries.\n",

    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">\n",
    "The transition probabilities for each square can be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For squares without snakes or ladders, the transition probability is uniformly distributed over the next 6 squares (or fewer if near the end of the board).\n",
    "- For squares with ladders, the transition probability is 1 for the square at the top of the ladder.\n",
    "- For squares with snakes, the transition probability is 1 for the square at the tail of the snake.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a player is on square 1, the transition probabilities are:\n",
    "- P(2|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(3|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(4|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(5|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(6|1) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(7|1) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also write it as this. If a player is on square k, the transition probabilities are:\n",
    "- P(k+1|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+2|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+3|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+4|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+5|k) = 1/6\n",
    "- P(k+6|k) = 1/6\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player is on square 4 (bottom of a ladder to 14), the transition probability is:\n",
    "- P(14|4) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player is on square 34 (head of a snake to 6), the transition probability is:\n",
    "- P(6|34) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can therefore have $P(s'|s) = \\frac{1}{6}$ if $s' = s+r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if $s\\geq 94$, we have to ensure that players to not exceed position 100. For example, $T(97, 100) = \\frac{2}{6}$ because rolling 3 or more lands the player at 100. \n",
